Hi! This is my first article in this blog. The idea of create this comes when I was trying to start to work as a Blockchain Engineer or in a similar position. With almost no experience and recently graduated  was imposible to me find a job in this position. So I decided to make this Blog: 

* First, to help me with the learning of this technology, because there is not too much about this technology in a technologicly way talking. Most of the information is about investments and that kind of things. And to improve my english and redaction skills as well, been honest.
* Second, there are some courses about learn Blockchain technologyly speaking but to be honest I don't feel really confortable paying on this courses because there are a lot of scams there outside. So, I think that there are people who thinks like me and this could be helpfull to them and of course completly free and public.
* Third, this could be a reflection of my knowledge that can help me on show what can I do with out the expertise of a company. 

So! There is not going to be too much more on this 'Chapter 0'. Just enjoy it, i hope it helps you as well as me and every mistake that you would find or every recommendation about this, write me. It's going to  me a lot.

Thanks for reading.
